# Bokeh Website Plot

This repository contains code used to create an HTML-embedable interactive Bokeh plot. I used this code for a project on [my personal website](https://zvanderbosch.com/debris_monitoring/). 

When creating my Github Pages website [Source](https://github.com/zvanderbosch/zvanderbosch.github.io), I wanted to include an interactive Bokeh plot which allowed people to selectively view different data sets comprising the light curve of a certain white dwarf star. The python script **bokeh_web_plot.py** will generate HTML which can be copied and pasted into your website project.
